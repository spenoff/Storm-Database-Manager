# Storm Database Manager
Using a Java IDE, run StormStatServer.java and follow the instructions.
Note: This repository is missing two packages. To my surprise, it only happened when I committed. I will update it once I figure out what went wrong.
If you save the data, it will be saved under hurricane.ser.
